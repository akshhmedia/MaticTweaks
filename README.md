**This application has been tested and confirmed to be Windows 10 compatible**, and I have personally tested it on every stable Windows release. However, if you encounter problems or some features do not work as expected, please double-check your installation or reinstall. Please remember that I cannot be held liable for any damage caused to your system due to using this application, so use it at your own risk.

Please remember that **I have not tested this application on Windows 8 or 11**, so I cannot guarantee that it will work with those operating systems. If you use this application on Windows 8 or 11, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge that I cannot support those systems. Thank you very much.
